                    People often think of rehabilitation as the final step in recovering from an illness or injury.

One important but often overlooked part of this process is making a smooth transition from rehab back home. This article will discuss what you need to know about care transitions and discharge programs at rehab facilities.

                            The Care Transitions & Discharge Program is a federally funded program that helps to ensure that patients have a smooth and safe transition from the hospital to their homes. The program provides patient-centered care coordination and support, which helps to reduce preventable hospital readmissions. The Care Transitions & Discharge Program is important because it helps to improve the quality of care for patients.

                        <p>
                            By providing coordinated support and care, the program can help to ensure that patients have a successful transition home. This can reduce the risk of hospital readmissions, which can be costly and dangerous for patients. If you or a loved one has been hospitalized, it is important to know about the Care Transitions & Discharge Program. The program can provide crucial support during your transition home, and can help to ensure a safe and smooth transition.

                    Who is eligible for the program?

                <p>
                    The first thing to know is that not everyone is eligible for the program. In order to be eligible, you must meet certain requirements. For example, you must be able to live independently and be able to take care of yourself once you leave the rehabilitation center. You must also have a plan in place for how you will continue your <a href="https://wheaton.cadiahealthcare.com/cadia-healthcare-wheathon/how-to-improve-your-rehabilitation-outcomes/">rehabilitation</a> once you leave the center.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you meet the eligibility requirements, then the care transitions and discharge program can be a great way to ensure a smooth transition home. The program will help connect you with resources in your community that can help you continue your rehabilitation. This can include services like home health care or transportation services.

                    The care transitions and discharge program at rehabilitation centers can last anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. It all depends on each individual’s needs and the severity of their condition. However, during this time, patients will be evaluated and monitored so that they can make a smooth transition back into their community. In addition, the staff at the rehabilitation center will work with the patient’s doctor to come up with a plan for aftercare. This may include follow-up appointments or medication management.
